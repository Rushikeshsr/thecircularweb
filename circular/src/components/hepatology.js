                Hepatitis is a global public health challenge that affects millions of lives. It is an inflammation of the liver, often caused by viral infections, toxins, or autoimmune diseases. If left undiagnosed and untreated, Hepatitis can lead to severe liver damage, liver failure, and even liver cancer. It is crucial to understand the different types of Hepatitis, their modes of transmission, and the potential consequences they pose.
            </p>
            <p className='paragh'>
                There are several types of Hepatitis, including Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. Each type has unique characteristics and can be transmitted through various routes such as contaminated food and water, unsafe sexual practices, sharing of needles, or from mother to child during childbirth. By increasing awareness about the modes of transmission, we can take proactive measures to prevent Hepatitis infections.

                <span style={{fontSize:"20px",color:"#00ff0d"}}>The Importance of Early Identification and Diagnosis</span><br/>
                Early identification and diagnosis play a vital role in managing Hepatitis and preventing its complications. Many people infected with Hepatitis may not exhibit noticeable symptoms initially, making it crucial to undergo regular screenings and tests. Routine blood tests can detect the presence of Hepatitis viruses, enabling early intervention and appropriate medical care.
            </p>
            <p className='paragh'>
                At The Circular, we advocate for regular screenings, especially for individuals at higher risk, such as healthcare workers, individuals with multiple sexual partners, people who inject drugs, and those with a history of blood transfusions. By prioritizing early identification, we can ensure timely treatment, minimize liver damage, and improve long-term health outcomes.

                Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver and can cause both acute and chronic liver disease. It is important to understand the severity of Hepatitis B and take appropriate measures to protect your liver health. Here's an overview of the different stages and potential complications associated with Hepatitis B
            </p>
            <p data-aos="slide-left" data-aos-delay="100" className='paragh'>
                <span style={{fontSize:"15px",color:"#00ff0d"}}>1. Acute Hepatitis B :</span> &nbsp;
                Acute Hepatitis B refers to the initial infection with the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). Many individuals may not experience any symptoms during this stage, while others may develop flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Most adults who acquire acute Hepatitis B recover completely within a few months without any long-term liver damage.
            </p>
            <p data-aos="slide-left" data-aos-delay="100" className='paragh'>
                <span style={{fontSize:"15px",color:"#00ff0d"}}>2. Chronic Hepatitis B :</span> &nbsp;
                If the Hepatitis B virus persists in the body for more than six months, it is considered chronic Hepatitis B. Chronic Hepatitis B can have varying degrees of severity and may lead to long-term complications. While some individuals with chronic Hepatitis B may remain asymptomatic, others may experience ongoing liver inflammation, which can result in liver damage over time.
            </p>
            <p data-aos="slide-left" data-aos-delay="100" className='paragh'>
                <span style={{fontSize:"15px",color:"#00ff0d"}}>3. Liver Cirrhosis :</span> &nbsp;
                Chronic Hepatitis B can progress to a more severe stage called liver cirrhosis. Cirrhosis occurs when the liver becomes scarred due to continuous inflammation and damage. As scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, the liver's ability to function properly is compromised. Symptoms of liver cirrhosis may include fatigue, jaundice, abdominal swelling, easy bruising or bleeding, and mental confusion.
            </p>

                <span style={{fontSize:"15px",color:"#00ff0d"}}>4. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Liver Cancer) :</span> &nbsp;
                Individuals with chronic Hepatitis B are at an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the most common form of liver cancer. Chronic inflammation and liver cirrhosis contribute to the development of liver cancer. Early detection and treatment are crucial for better outcomes.
