               With a meticulous incision that traverses seven layers, the C-Section surgery demands awe and reverence. Yet, astonishingly, society often overlooks the monumental challenges faced by women who undergo this procedure. As we delve into the experiences of women who have undergone cesarean deliveries, a troubling pattern emerges. In suburban, rural, and even some urban middle-class families, the plight of these mothers is often met with indifference. It is disheartening to witness even elderly women in the household neglecting the needs of the mother, redirecting their focus solely on celebrating the arrival of the newborn.

                We must confront this negligence head-on and strive for a paradigm shift in the way we approach childbirth. To rectify the shortcomings and neglect surrounding C-sections, we must foster a culture of care and love. It begins with education and awareness, enlightening society about the complexities and challenges faced by mothers who undergo this procedure.

                Healthcare providers, families, and communities must unite in providing the necessary support, empathy, and understanding to ensure the holistic well-being of these courageous women. By embracing the transformative power of compassion, we can reshape the narrative surrounding C-sections.
