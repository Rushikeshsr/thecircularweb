                We are proud to announce our partnership with DESC (Digital Education and Skills Council) to promote sustainability through education across India. DESC is a remarkable initiative driven by influential government officials who hold key decision-making positions. With a shared commitment to supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDG) by 2030, DESC focuses on leveraging education as a catalyst for positive change.

                At The Circular, we strongly believe in the power of education to transform communities and create a sustainable future. Our partnership with DESC aligns perfectly with our vision and mission to build sustainable communities through education. Together, we aim to drive awareness, empower individuals, and inspire action towards building a more sustainable and resilient society.

                We are delighted to share that our president, Mr. Abhay Chakra Sadineni, has been selected as a member of DESC and has been voted as their Director of International Relations and Communications. This prestigious role allows us to actively contribute to DESC's initiatives and collaborate on various projects that promote sustainability, education, and positive social impact.

                One of the significant contributions we have made in partnership with DESC is a nationwide medical and disease surveillance project. This project aims to monitor and analyze health-related data to identify potential outbreaks, track the spread of diseases, and implement timely interventions. The Circular has played a pivotal role in driving this project forward, leveraging our expertise in healthcare, technology, and community engagement.
            </p>
            <p className='paragh'>
                Through this partnership, we are not only strengthening our commitment to promoting sustainability through education but also expanding our reach and impact across the nation. We believe that by joining forces with DESC, we can create a significant and lasting change in the lives of individuals, communities, and the environment.
